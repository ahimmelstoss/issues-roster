# Issues Roster

## Description

Issue Roster shows you all of the open issues and pull requests of all of the repos in the organizations you are a part of on Github.

## Background

I was looking for something to do and contribute to during downtime and looking through the issues of each individual repo in all of the organizations I'm a part of is annoying.
